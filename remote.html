							<h2>Estimation of Forest Aboveground Biomass (AGB) Density In Uganda's Forested regions using Remote sensing and Machine Learning Methods</h2>
							<div class="row">
								<div class="col-6 col-12-small">		
									<p style="text-align:justify">Estimating Above Ground Biomass (AGB) with satellite imagery data involves the exploitation of advanced remote sensing analytical 
										methods to derive and quantify the amount of biomass present in a given area (Yingchang L. et al., 2020)<br><br>
										  
										üå≥üõ∞Ô∏è This script employs Remote sensed data, including Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) L4B, Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, Copernicus elevation, and 
										slope datasets, to create a model for the Estimation Above Ground Biomass (AGB) density in Uganda's forested regions. The most forested areas in Uganda are in  
										western Uganda and so I chose Kibaale district in western Uganda as a case study.   <br> <br>

										üå≤üíª The script utilizes the power of the Random Forest (RF) classifier to predict AGB density, considering various factors like polarization data, slope, elevation,
										and cloud-filtered Sentinel II images. Results from the model provides insights into the dynamics of forest structure and AGB, contributing to our understanding of
										ecological health of forests in Uganda.</p>

							<h2>Vegetation Status Mapping in Uganda's Urban Metropolitans.</h2>
								<div class="row">
									<div class="col-6 col-12-small">		
										<p style="text-align:justify">Vegetation status mapping is one of the most important steps in deriving solutions for sustainable natural resource management and Agriculture. 
											Results from vegetation mapping provide key inventory for agricultural field assessments, classification and archiving of vegetation data (Samrat Deb et al., 2022). 
											With a focus on Uganda urban metropolitans, this analysis focuses on Gulu district which is one of districts that have just achieved city status. Gulu formally became a city in
											July 2020 and most international urban design specialists, and academic researchers have directed their efforts to examine the  most sustainable processes of urban planning in Gulu.
											 
											This script takes the initiative to exploit remote sensing technologies by implementing industry vegetation indices to derive vegetation health coverage. Results from this analysis 
											provide potentials for environmental monitoring, offering crucial insights and precautionary measures for natural resource management and agricultural sustainability in Gulu district. 
											(The script allows analysis for other study areas by assigning the district name as a variable).  The indices utilized in this mapping include;
											<ol>
												<li>NDVI, EVI, and kNDVI for assessing vegetation greenness and vigor.</li>
												<li>Leaf Area Index (LAI) aids in estimating vegetated area yields.</li>
												<li>Canopy Chlorophyll Content Index (CCCI) assesses canopy nitrogen content.</li>
												<li>The Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) evaluates vegetation water/moisture content.</li>
												<li>Canopy Fire Potential Index estimates vegetation canopy susceptibility to fire under specific conditions.</li>

									<h3>Using Remote Sensing to Assess Fire Severity and Vegetation 
										Regeneration</h3>	
									<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/Burn.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p style="text-align:justify">Appropriate assessment of ecosystems and biodiversity affected by fire epidemics is crucial to modelling and forecasting post-fire activities for managing and  
										recovery of affected areas (Chu, T., & Guo, X. 2013). Earth observation measurements have been identified as effective and efficient tools for assessing, monitoring, and predicting wildfires, as well as getting a  
										better understanding of how forest ecosystems respond to them (Efthimiou, N., Psomiadis, E., & Panagos, P. 2019). This study utilized Landsat 8 multi-spectral satellite data to derive spectral indices and employed supervised classification 
										to assess burn severity extent and post-fire vegetation recovery. The differenced Normalised Burn Ratio (dNBR) index derived from the difference between pre-fire NBR and post-fire NBR, 
										Normalized Difference Vegetation Index NDVI and Geographical Information System (GIS) was applied to analyse fire impact for a post-fire occurrence period of nine months. This study highlights 
										results obtained from both supervised classification and spectral indices, showing deficiencies in the use of the current approach while giving an accurate assessment of the results.

									<h3>The Role of Remote Sensing in Flood Mapping</h3>
									<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/Floods.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p style="text-align:justify">Floods frequently occur around the world, causing a significant impact on life and economies at large. Mitigation and response mechanisms in flood-prone areas are
										in high demand due to the disastrously impactful and unexpected character floods hold (Sanyal et al., 2003). Attempts have been made in recent years to warn decision-makers to develop mechanisms that provide 
										a good overview for mitigation, planning, response, and recovery for areas at risk. Flood disaster management literature is observable that use earth observation techniques to understand risk  
										and aftermath damages of flood occurrence. Considering the magnitude of impact floods can impose on areas (Domeneghetti et al., 2019), this review discusses applications of remote sensing used in flood observation and 
										delineation, damage assessment and vulnerability. Different stakeholders involved in monitoring, evaluation and management of flood disasters include meteorological authorities, disaster 
										as well as relief organisations. This study provides an in-depth description of satellite, data and classification methodologies applied in flood mapping. It highlights the cartographic products 
										derived from critical studies, as well as accuracy assessments executed to validate results. </p>

									<h3>Viticulture - Using remote sensing to derive and assess vineyard status. </h3>
									<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/Vines.png" alt="" /></a>
									
									<p style="text-align:justify"> ‚ÄúHealthy vineyard fields require careful attention to the smallest detail affecting the growth of grapes. Depending on the end purpose of the grapevines, viticulture 
										studies suggest various activities for their successful management (J.L. Smit et al., 2010). Practices like irrigation, site selection, and canopy management can be performed more effectively with the use of modern technologies such as remote sensing (HOFF, R. et al 2016) <br>
										This project covered vineyard fields in the north and southern parts of Portugal. Both drone and satellite imagery, were obtained, pre-processed, and processed to obtain composite images. 
										These composites were transformed to produce plant-level NDVI. Plant-level NDVI for all vineyards was processed every week. Results from the plant-level NDVI provided clients with early detection of pests &
										diseases, assessment of grape quality and yield estimates.

									<h3>Assessing the Impact of Road Establishment on Settlement Using Remote Sensing and GIS. </h3>
									<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/road.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p style="text-align:justify"> Construction of essential infrastructure like roads is an important factor causing urban land use changes (Goodchild, Michael F., 2010).. The Kampala Northern Bypass Highway was constructed between 2004 and 2009 and it was opened 
										to traffic on 1st October 2009. This project assesses the impact of road establishment on settlement by conducting a comparative analysis for some areas around the Kampala northern bypass before and after establishment of the road. Using 
										Standard Landsat satellite imagery produced in 2001 and 2010, land-use changes in the last 9 years for areas along the northern bypass were derived.  The data was processed and analyzed using remote sensing and GIS techniques. Results show 
										that major changes that have occurred in settlements in the last 8-10 years period have been largely contributed by the establishment of this road. Over all the results point to a decline in swamps, vegetated area, crop land and an    
										increase in infrastructural development (built up area) like commercial buildings, residential building, roads. You can see the documentation of the study by following the link below.</p>

									<h3>Evaluate the performance of pan-sharpening techniques to increase the spatial resolution of the satellite images</h3>
									<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/remote/pan/nn_defuse.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p style="text-align:justify"> In this project, we used seven different panchromatic image sharpening 
										methods to find the best pan-sharpening method to improve the spatial and spectral resolution of 
										the Deimos2 optical sensor. The method evaluation consists of two analytical methods, visual 
										analysis and quantitative analysis. Of the seven methods, the nearest-neighbor diffusion 
										(NN diffusion) pan-sharpening method developed in ENVI 5.1 offers the best results over the other
											methods.</p>

									<h3>Air Quality Monitoring Using Sentinel-5 Satellite Imagery.</h3>
									<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/Air quality.jpg" alt="" /></a>		
									
									<p style="text-align:justify"> Air pollution in urban areas mainly as a result of industrial and motor vehicle emissions, is currently causing major health problems to people (B.W Bodah et al., 2022). With millions of people facing health issues as a direct 
										result of air toxics, it causes more concern to investigate areas that are at higher risk. This analysis was done to assess the concentration of Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) for Portugal at large. According to the <a href="https://www.lung.org/clean-air/outdoors/what-makes-air-unhealthy/nitrogen-dioxide">American Lung Association, </a> Nitrogen dioxide is 
										one of the major causes of lung diseases. Results of this analysis show a high concentration of Nitrogen dioxide  in Lisbon and Porto which are the main central business districts in Portugal. You can see the analysis script by following the link below. 
										the methodologies behind those studies. </p>
